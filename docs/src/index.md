## Notes on dependencies

!!! note

    CitableCorpusAnalysis uses the python `nltk` module for its sample English-language pos tagger.  To use it, you need to install `nltk`.  This is one way to do that:

    `pip install nltk`

    then at a python prompt,

    `import nltk`

    `nltk.download`

Resume normal operations now.
